    "\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "- ggplot2\n",
    "- plotly\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "When making a basic chart, such as a scatterplot, one could use any of these packages. Why choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data format: Perhaps you have your data already stored as a pandas data frame. In that case, the pandas package makes it very straightforward to visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Syntax preference: If you have already learned how to plot in Matlab, then matplotlib and seaborn will be easy to pick up as they have very similar approaches to plotting. If coming from R or if you are familiar with the grammar of graphics, you'll likely find ggplot2 to be the most welcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Style: The default colors and axis styles of each package differ. You can always tweak these features, but if you can use the default style to get close to your desired output, it makes the coding much quicker.\n",
