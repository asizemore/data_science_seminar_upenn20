# Code for tutorials in the Penn Data Science Seminar 2020


Each tutorial has it's own folder. Within the folder for a lecture, we assume the following directry structure:

```
*lecture_X*_*date*
│   *code_file.ipynb*    
│
└───data
    │   *downloaded data goes here*

```


You will need to download the data and add it to the "data" directory in order for the code to run. The necessary data will vary by lecture.


## Tutorial-specific instructions


**Lecture 1, June 25th**

Please download the `CCLE_expression.csv` and `sample_info.csv` files from the Dependency Map [website](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). Save both files in a directory titled "data" so that your lecture 4 directory has the same structure as above. The data for all figures in this lecture is included within the notebook. Catan dice rolls from 2016-2019 collected by [Taylor Patch](https://github.com/tcpatch).
