# Code for tutorials in the Penn Data Science Seminar 2020


Tutorials can be found in the python notebooks. Any data needed will be provided on Canvas, be linked and publicly available, or contained within the notebook itself. We assume the directory structure is as follows:

```
*tutorial_X*_*date*
│   *code_file.ipynb*    
│
└───data
    │   *downloaded data goes here*

```


You will need to download the data and add it to the "data" directory in order for the code to run. The necessary data will vary by tutorial.


## Tutorial-specific instructions


**Tutorial 1, June 25th**

Please download the `CCLE_expression.csv` and `sample_info.csv` files from the Dependency Map [website](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). Save both files in a directory titled "data" so that your lecture 4 directory has the same structure as above. The data for all figures in this lecture is included within the notebook.
